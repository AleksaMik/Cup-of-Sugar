  ## Description
  AS A friendly neighbor, I WANT a website that allows me to lend or borrow tools and appliances to/from people in my area, SO THAT people in my area and I do not have to buy or rent expensive tools and appliances for single use projects.

  ## Usage
  A live deployed link can be found here: https://sheltered-brook-61443.herokuapp.com/. After clicking the link, users can create a profile by clicking signup.

  Users can then view available rentals by category.

  ## Technologies
  To make this app function, we used React for frontend, Mongodb for our databases, Express for our server, CSS for styling, JWT for authentication, and Graphql for our data queries.
  
  ## Install
  First, clone the repo. Then open the file in VSCode and open the integrated terminal. Run the command "npm install" to install all the dependencies. After that is complete, you can then run "npm run develop" to run the program locally!
  
  ## Development
  For future development, we would like to add an interactive map using Google Map API so that users can see available items to rent displayed on a map. We would also like to implement a picture upload for posting rentals so that users can see the item to confirm it is the item they are looking for. We also think it would be cool to implement some sort of tip system, where users can leave tips to other users after borrowing items. This could be done by implementing Stripe.
